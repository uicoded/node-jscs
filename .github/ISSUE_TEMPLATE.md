### JSCS is deprecated

Thanks for wanting to contribute, but this project is deprecated.

We recommend using [ESLint](http://eslint.org/) instead (the JSCS team will be contributing there).

Check out our blog posts for more information:

* [JSCS End of Life](http://eslint.org/blog/2016/07/jscs-end-of-life)

> If you would like to contribute to the JSCS Compatibility Effort, follow the [milestone here](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/milestone/15).

Since we won't be maintaining the project, please do not open issues/PRs here. Thanks!
